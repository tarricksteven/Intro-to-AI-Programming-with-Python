    "Up to now we have seen how to make slices and select elements of an ndarray using indices. This is useful when we know the exact indices of the elements we want to select. However, there are many situations in which we don't know the indices of the elements we want to select. For example, suppose we have a 10,000 x 10,000 ndarray of random integers ranging from 1 to 15,000 and we only want to select those integers that are less than 20. Boolean indexing can help us in these cases, by allowing us select elements using logical arguments instead of explicit indices. Let's see some examples:"

    "We can also sort ndarrays in NumPy. We will learn how to use the np.sort() function to sort rank 1 and rank 2 ndarrays in different ways. Like with other functions we saw before, the sort function can also be used as a method. However, there is a big difference on how the data is stored in memory in this case. When np.sort() is used as a function, it sorts the ndrrays out of place, meaning, that it doesn't change the original ndarray being sorted. However, when you use sort as a method, ndarray.sort() sorts the ndarray in place, meaning, that the original array will be changed to the sorted one. Let's see some examples:"
